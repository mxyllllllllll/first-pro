        â€œSome of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss....<br>
        But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent,<br>

        She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired,
        freckle-faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside.
        The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters,
        so much in a hurry to hit the Earth, it has no time to flow down the spout.

        We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.
        We all waited, some patiently, others irritated, because nature messed up their hurried day.
        I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing
        away the dirt and dust of the world.<br>
